		<h1 class="faq-h1">FAQ: Common Tile & Tub Reglazing Services Questions </h1>
		<div class="blue-header">
		<div class="blue-header-text">Q: What is bathroom refinishing?</div>
	  </div>

		
	  <p><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Bathroom refinishing is the process of using a durable top coat to make your  existing bathroom look new for 1/10th of the cost of an actual remodeling  job.</p>
		
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What is the difference between reglazing my bathtub with your or another company in the area?</div>
	  </div>
		<p><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Just  like any other service industry, you get what you pay for. Companies without  experience or cheap materials may get the job done right at the beginning, but  you will see problems shortly after the job is done. Choose a company with  positive reviews, years of experience, and the most up to date methods who will  treat your bathtub, shower stall, or countertop like it is being done in their  own home.</p>


		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: How long does it take to complete the resurfacing process?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Depending on the size of the surface, it generally takes about 3-4 hours to  complete the resurfacing process. If your bathtub or shower stall has been  resurfaced before, please allow an extra hour to strip the old glaze and ensure  the surface is ready for reglazing.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Can I use my bathroom right after you refinish the surface?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>We  recommend letting the surface completely cure for 24 hours after the service  has been completed to ensure the proper adhesion and drying of the surface.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: How long does the reglazed surface last?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>If the  surface is properly taken care of and cleaned as instructed the surface should  last 10-15 years.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What if I have a problem with my refinished surface after the job is complete? What is your warranty policy?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Please  refer to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whiteglovereglazing.com/warranty-information.html" class="text-link"><strong>warranty page</strong></a>&nbsp;for our full warranty  policy for residential and commercial accounts.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Will I be able to tell that my surface was refinished?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Unless  you are a professional bathtub refinisher, most individuals are not able to  tell the bathtub was refinished. Almost all clients say that friends and family  believe they actually replaced the bathtub.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Is the newly finished surface slippery?</div>
	  </div>
	  <p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>The  newly finished surface on your bathtub is just as slippery as a new acrylic  bathtub. If you would like a non slip finish, we do offer that as well so you  do not have to buy one of those annoying mats. Contact us before your  appointment or ask our experts once we arrive about our non slip finishes.</p>
		<p>		  Non Slip surfaces can be applied to an existing bathtub or to a  newly finished bathtub. The non slip finish does not have any weird or sharp  feeling and is comfortable to enter into and out of your bathtub as well as a  comfortable bathing surface keeping you safe and secure.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: If the caulk around my bathtub is fading away, can you replace it?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Yes, we  do offer caulking of the edges of the bathtub before we complete our reglazing  service. If you believe you need it, just notify us before your appointment and  we will bring the proper tools.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What colors do you have available to paint my bathtub?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>We have many different colors available as well as cool colors specifically for  kitchen countertops. Visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whiteglovereglazing.com/pick-your-color.html" class="text-link"><strong>colors page</strong></a>&nbsp;to view all the options  we have.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What other surfaces does your company reglaze?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Here at  White Glove Bathtub and Tile Reglazing, we are able to refinish almost any  surface in a home. We offer reglazing on your bathtub, kitchen counter,  bathroom counter, sink, shower stall, tiles, floors, and much more. If your bathtub  needs to be caulked or if your tile needs to be regrouted before our  resurfacing service, just give us a heads up before your appointment to bring  the proper tools.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Why should I resurface my tile wall or floor?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>There  are multiple reasons to resurface your tile floors or walls. Most customers  have homes that have outdated colored tile such as pink, green, or blue tiles.  Rather than spending thousands on regrouting the tile as well as switching them  out and not being able to use your bathroom for months, call us today and have  it reglazed. The process takes 3-4 hours and makes the bathroom, kitchen, or  shower stall look good as new. If you need to regrout your tiles, our  professionals have the tools to do that too, also at a fraction of the price.  Check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whiteglovereglazing.com/tile-refinishing.html" class="text-link"><strong>tile refinishing service</strong></a>&nbsp;for more  information about this.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What is countertop refinishing?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Countertop resurfacing is the same process we use for tiles and bathtubs. Most  of our customers choose this service from White Glove Bathtub And Tile  Reglazing to renew the look of their kitchen or bathroom counters to have the  look and feel of granite without the huge expense. Our prime colors for  countertops give your countertop the look of a brand new finished countertop in  as little as one day.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: How should we clean the newly finished surface?</div>
	  </div>
		<p><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Please refer to our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whiteglovereglazing.com/warranty-information.html" class="text-link"><strong>warranty page</strong></a>&nbsp;to view our cleaning  instructions for your new surface.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Does the reglazing process smell?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>The  sprays we use are environmentally friendly and non toxic. Our professionals also  ventilate the area during the process to help dissipate the smell and ensure it  does not stay for long. Generally the smell will stay for about 2-3 hours after  the work is complete.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What should we do to prepare the area for resurfacing?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Please  ensure the area we will be working in is dry and clear of any items. We will  generally cover the surrounding area to ensure the resurfacing materials do not  touch anywhere but the area being resurfaced. If you have a drain or faucet  that is dripping, this must be taken care of before we arrive to allow the  surface to properly cure and dry.&nbsp;Please  do not just cover or turn off the faucet. With a leaky faucet, just like your  original surface, it will cause erosion much sooner than later.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: When should i refinish my bathtub? Before or after renovations?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>We  suggest to reglaze your surfaces after renovations are done. Our warranty does  not cover man made damage and we also prefer to work in a non dusty environment  to ensure the surface sticks with no bubbles or dust stuck underneath. Our  professionals clean the area before working, but with remodeling being  performed, there will always be dust in the air.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What if we have a plumbing problem?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>These issues must be  resolved by an actual licensed plumber. We are able to change faucet covers or  drain covers as they do not require any actual plumbing to be done, but our  professionals are not trained to perform plumbing work.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q Do you offer reglazing services for Commercial/Industrial properties and accounts?</div>
	  </div>
	  <p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Yes we offer reglazing services for hospitals,  coops, universities and more. For a complete list <a href="https://www.whiteglovereglazing.com/commercial-accounts.html" class="text-link">click here</a>.</p>
