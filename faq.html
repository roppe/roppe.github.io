		<h1 class="faq-h1">FAQ: Tile and Tub Reglazing Frequently Asked Questions  </h1>
		<div class="blue-header">
		<div class="blue-header-text">Q: What is bathroom reglazing?</div>
	  </div>

		
	  <p><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Bathroom refinishing is basically the process of applying a durable coating to make the fixtures in your bathroom look like new. It can cost just 10% of the cost of remodeling job.</p>
		
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Why should I choose you and not another company?</div>
	  </div>
		<p><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Remember, you get what you pay for. Even though you may find cheaper companies in Houston, TX, we assure you that you won't get the same results with them. We use only the best materials, solutions and tools to make sure we do an excellent job every time. Our experts have more than 20 years of combined experience.</p>


		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: How long does it take your experts to finish the reglazing process?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>: Generally, it takes our technicians anywhere between 2 and 4 hours to complete the resurfacing project. In case the tub has been previously reglazed, it will take an extra hour for our expert to strip the old glaze.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Can I use my tub, sink or toilet after the reglazing process is complete?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Unfortunately, no. The glaze needs to cure, and this takes around 24 hours. We advise against using the surface during this time.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: How long does the glaze last?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>If you properly maintain the surface, the glaze should last 10 to 15 years.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: What if I have a problem with my refinished surface after the job is complete? What is your warranty policy?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Residential and commercial clients receive a warranty, of course .Read the  &nbsp;<a href="sparkle-houston-warranty.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-link"><strong>Warranty Agreement</strong></a>&nbsp;for more information. </p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Can you tell that the tub has been resurfaced?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>
			: If the reglazing process has been done by an expert, it's almost impossible to spot a reglazed tub. Even though a professional bathtub refinisher can tell the difference, most individuals can't.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q:Is the refinished tub or shower slippery?</div>
	  </div>
	  <p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Yes, the refinished surface is just like the old surface. It is slippery when wet. However, you can simply order our Anti-Slip treatment and we'll apply a comfortable, adherent coating to the bathtub or floor. Slipping is almost impossible on this kind of surface.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: Can you replace the ugly caulking around my tub?</div>

	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>All the solutions we use are non-toxic and environmentally friendly.

		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q: How can I help your experts with the reglazing process?</div>
	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>: The area we will work in needs to be dry and clear of all items. Also, make sure the faucet is not dripping. Turning it off or covering it is not a solution, so you should hire a licensed plumber to repair the faucet. We will cover the entire area around the tub ourselves to make sure the materials don't touch any other surface.</p>
		<div class="blue-header">
          <div class="blue-header-text">Q:I'm planning to renovate. Should I reglaze the tub?</div>
	  </div>

	  </div>
		<p class="p-answer"><span class="section-heading">A: </span>Unfortunately, our experts are not trained to do plumbing work. Hire a licensed plumber if you need help with the plumbing. If it's only a faucet cover or drain cover that needs to be changed, we can help you though</p>
